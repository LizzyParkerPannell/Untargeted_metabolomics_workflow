## Metabolite Extraction and Data acquisition

{{< figure src="/images/metabolite_extraction.png" >}}

We will not go into the details of quenching, metabolite extraction or choice of mass spectrometry platform here 
(as to some extent they will be specific to the organism and/ or tissue involved and what questions you are trying to answer).

These references may be of use in comparing methods and making decisions (while they are focussed mostly on plants, much of the information is relevant to other complex biological samples):
