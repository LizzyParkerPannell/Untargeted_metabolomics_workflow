Many thanks to [RSE Sheffield](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield) for their help and guidance in sharing the workflow.

### Website Theme

The website theme was adapted from [RSE Sheffield's github training course](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/git-github-zero-to-hero). The workshop materials website itself is based on the [hugo-theme-learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) and further configurations were inspired by Maëlle Salmon's course site on [**Scientific blogging with R Markdown**](https://github.com/maelle/rmd-blogging-course).
