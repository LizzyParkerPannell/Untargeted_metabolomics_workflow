## What are my metabolites?

> :warning: Sadly this stage is not automated and will be the stage that takes the longest, so make sure youâ€™re fairly happy with the preceding analysis before you commit time to this.

Annotating metabolomic features is challenging - there are some automated annotations included with e.g. `XCMS` that rely on the `CAMERA` package amongst others. However, these often struggle with unusual experimental structures and/ or large datasets, "unusual" (read: non human) metabolites etc. So here we have reduced the number of metabolomic features we want to annotate to just those that are causing a significant (in terms of reliability *and* magnitude) difference between two classes of samples.

To understand what these features might be, we will compare the m/z (or m/z with RT) values highlighted by our multivariate analysis with databases of reference m/z and with experimental data from the literature (usually available in the paper or in a repository like [MetaboLights]"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/search?").

*At this point you should have a list of metabolomic features of interest with m/z to min. 4 decimal places*
