The following are examples of data sets that can be used to trial the workflow or for training purposes:

- [MALDI sustainable soils teaching data set](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dbrv15f5c)

- [LC-MS sweet potato dataset under the MetaboLights accession ID MTBLS2956](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2956/files)

We would encourage anyone who uses the workflow to contribute links to their datasets via [github](https://github.com/LizzyParkerPannell/Untargeted_metabolomics_workflow).
