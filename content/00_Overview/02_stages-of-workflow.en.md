## Stages of the workflow

The workflow has been divided into stages. We use the following number codes in the documentation presented here as well as in the R code and workflow diagram.


00 - Overviews, workflow diagram + useful information
01 - Metabolite extraction
02 - Data acquisition (Mass Spectrometry)
03 - Converting data to open format
04 - Data pre-processing
05 - Extracting + formatting peak table + metadata
06 - Multivariate analysis (PCA) + further analysis (if applicable)
07 - Putative metabolite identification
08 - Archiving data + citing resources

<br>

N.B. Stages 01 and 02 are not covered in great detail in this documentation which focusses more on data processing
and analysis.

## Resources and further reading

We can’t cover everything in this guide but there are lots of other useful resources out there. 
Here are some general metabolomics workflow resources you may find useful:

* [Miao Yu’s guide 2021](https://bookdown.org/yufree/Metabolomics/) (particularly useful as links to a lot of literature and other tools that we have not covered here) 
* [R for Mass Spectrometry 2016](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/metaRbolomics-book/) (nearly everything you could need for doing metabolomics in R BUT relies on proficiency in R)
