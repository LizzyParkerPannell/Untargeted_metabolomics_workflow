## File conversion using Proteowizard

Download the [Proteowizard software]() and install. Within Proteowizard are two applications:

* SeeMS
* MSConvert

SeeMS is really useful for viewing chromatograms and spectra when you don't have access to proprietary software like MassLynx. However we are not going to
use SeeMS directly here (although it's worth having a play and checking your raw spectra).

### MSConvert
